## wallet.funding.request.updated

Triggered when the **status of a wallet fund request changes** — typically when the wire is received and the wallet is credited.

**Trigger:** The fund request status is updated (e.g., wire received and matched → `COMPLETED`).

---

## Status Lifecycle

```
PENDING → COMPLETED  (wire received and matched)
        ↘ FAILED    (wire not received / rejected)
        ↘ CANCELED  (request canceled)
```

---

Same schema as `wallet.funding.request.initiated`. The `data.status` and `data.updatedAt` fields reflect the new state.
