## wallet.withdraw.wire.updated

Triggered whenever the **status** of a wire withdrawal changes. This event fires multiple times across the transfer lifecycle.

**Trigger:** Wire transfer status is updated by the banking network.

---

## Status Lifecycle

```
PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED
                    ↘ FAILED
PENDING → CANCELED
```

> This event fires once per status transition. The sample shows the first update (`PROCESSING`). A second fire will follow when status moves to `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`.
